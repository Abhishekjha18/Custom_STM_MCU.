# **Custom Microcontroller Board with Multi-Shield Support**  

## Overview  
This project features a **custom-designed microcontroller board** with optimized **hardware interfaces and firmware**, developed using **CubeMX**. It supports **four interchangeable shields**, allowing multiple functionalities to be deployed simultaneously.  

## Features  
- **Custom PCB Design** – Developed using **KiCad** (schematics & layout available in this repository).  
- **Optimized Firmware** – Configured and fine-tuned with **CubeMX** for efficient performance.  
- **Multi-Shield Support** – Simultaneously deploy up to **four shields** with distinct functionalities.  
- **Scalable & Modular** – Easily adaptable for various embedded applications.  

## Access KiCad Files  
All **schematic and PCB design files** are available in the **KiCad_Files** directory of this repository. Clone or download them to modify or manufacture your custom board.  

1. Open **KiCad** and load the project files from the **KiCad_Files** folder.  
2. Use **CubeMX** to configure or modify firmware as needed.  
3. Flash the firmware to the microcontroller and test with your desired shields.
